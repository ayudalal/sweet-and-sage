                <p class="dateEntry1">06.06.25</p>
                <p> Entry #1: Welcome to Sweet and Sage! Our first recipe, a strawberry matcha, is a perfect symbol for 
                    what our blog is all about and will be perfect for the upcoming summer season. Featuring a sweet strawberry puree 
                    paired with creamy oat milk and earthy matcha, this drink is sure to brighten up your day.
                    We chose our name - Sweet and Sage - to signify that the combination of challenge and comfort is necessary within 
                    our lives. The sweet moments: laughing with your friends, dinner with your family, staying up watching your favorite
                     TV show. And the tough moments: dealing with self-doubt, persisting through change, and grappling with uncertainty.
                    Currently, as high school juniors, our lives are riddled with questions about our future. How will one bad grade affect
                     my chances at college? What should I write my college essay about? What am I even passionate about? Fears can easily 
                     consume our daily thoughts. This period of our lives can feel bitter and overwhelming - sort of like matcha on its own.
                    Yet, there is still sweetness that cuts through. In the midst of so much noise, there is the smell of coffee in the early 
                    morning. The playlist that hits perfectly in the car. The comfort of your bed after a long day. These small, sweet things
                     do not fix all the problems, but they remind you that there is more to life than just the hard parts.
                    We are trying to remind ourselves that both struggle and comfort make us who we are. And our strawberry matcha helps to 
                    demonstrate that balance is everything. You need both flavors for the drink to be whole, and maybe that is true for us, 
                    too. We all are still figuring things out, but if we hold the sweet and sage together, that is enough for now. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>- three large strawberries </li>

                        <li>- 1/4 cup hot water</li>
                        <li>- maple syrup</li>

                        <li>First, dice 3 large strawberries and place them in a pan with your sugar. 2 teaspoons is enough to make 
                            the puree mildly sweet, so feel free to scale the sugar up or down based on your preference. </li>
                        <div> <img src="entry1step2.jpg" alt="e1s2"> </div>
                        <li>Allow this mixture to cook on medium for 5-10 minutes while continuously stirring to prevent it from sticking. 
                            The strawberries should soften and liquefy into a puree. </li>
                        <div> <img src="entry1step3.jpg" alt="e1s3"> </div>
                        <li>Next, break up the large pieces of strawberry within the mixture. We recommend using a fork, emulsifier, 
                            or blender to get rid of chunks. Allow the puree to cool while you make your matcha. </li>
                        <div> <img src="entry1step4.jpg" alt="e1s4"> </div>
                        <li>Soak your matcha whisk in some warm water to prevent breakage during whisking.</li>
                        <div> <img src="entry1step5.jpg" alt="e1s5"> </div>
                        <li>Make your matcha as usual. We recommend a ratio of 2 teaspoons of matcha powder with Â¼ cups of hot water. 
                            Whisk till the matcha is frothy and you see bubbles. </li>

                        <li>Fill your cup with cooled puree and your desired amount of ice. </li>

                        <li>Add your oatmilk and maple syrup to the glass. Alternatively, agave syrup or sweetened creamer would also
                             work well to sweeten the drink. </li>

                        <li>Lastly, add your matcha tea to the glass.</li>
